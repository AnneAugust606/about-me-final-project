          <p class="needsBorder">
            I am an 18 year old living in Utah, USA. I am an up-and-coming Front
            End Designer and I am very excited to be on this journey. I am very
            thankful for all the opportunities I have in my life. I enjoy
            gardening, baking, scuba diving, and of corse; Programing.
            Throughout high school I was a member of the Programing Club. I
            mostly joined because My older brother had made the club and wanted
            members, but within that club I found a passion. I am passionate
            about what I do and I plan to continue this path and continue to
            grow and build on my skills.

            <p class="needsBorder">
              I owe my initial introduction to programing to my older brother,
              who aspires to be a vide game designer, and has taught me a lot of
              what I know today. I love my family to pieces. My dad was the one
              who was determined to get all of us kids into Scuba Diving and I
              cannot thank him enough. My dad inherited his love for water from
              his dad, my grandfather, who was a Mechanical Engineer and Soldier
              in WWII and used swimming and scuba diving as a treatment for his
              PTSD. He would always take his kids (my dad, aunts and uncles) to
              go scuba diving together and my dad takes it apron himself to
              continue the tradition. Us kids are more than willing to help him.

              I plan to continue to grow my programming skills and make a career
              in programing and web design. I have many websites and apps I want
              to create, and I also would like to work making websites for other
              people and companies. I simply want to become the best I can be. I
              want to work on projects and learn more about myself, more skills,
              and more about this field that I love.

            <p class="needsBorder">
              My passions are, firstly, Programing. I love doing it, and I have
              a knack for problem solving so it works out just fine. I hope to
              continue to grow my skills as I move forward. But Iâ€™m also
              passionate about baking and gardening. I grew up very rural out in
              Western America and I have deep ties with working with the earth.
              Many believe Tech and Agriculture are two separate worlds, but
              many times they are similar. Each take planning, lay out, hard
              work, cleaning out bugs (or bugs and weeds), and sometimes things
              donâ€™t work out perfectly. But you learn and move on. And when
              you're done you get to celebrate. Or at least I like too. And even
              after you harvest you have to take care of the soil, like you have
              to take care of your programs. I donâ€™t find them all too
              different.

              I am growing new skills every day as I continue through the
              SheCodes corse, pursue my education, and practice my skills. I am
              already very skilled in website creation, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
              thanks to SheCodes and my Older Brother. I also have a knack for
              design, problem solving, and finding problems no one knew they
              had. Which I have been told is the mark of a good programer. I
              have also worked may Retail, Customer Service, and food industry
              jobs. If your interested check out

            <p class="needsBorder">
              I have worked in a few different places. I got my first job while
              in high school at Michaels Crafts. Which was really fun. After I
              graduated high school I got myself a job at Fresh Market in the
              Deli Section and later Arbyâ€™s. I got my food handlers through that
              job and it taught me a lot. I defiantly learned to respect food
              industry. My parentâ€™s motto was always â€˜Everyone should work as
              many different types of jobs as possible. Especially Food service
              and Retail. They open you up to new world views you wouldnâ€™t have
              otherwise and they teach you to respect everyone you come across.â€™
              And I couldnâ€™t agree more.
